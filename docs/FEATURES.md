---

## Infrastructure Lab (v1.2)

Separate Docker Compose stack in `infrastructure/` simulating the client network.

### Wazuh SIEM Stack (4.14.2)
- **wazuh-manager**: log collection, agent management, alert rules
- **wazuh-indexer**: OpenSearch-based log storage
- **wazuh-dashboard**: web UI at `https://localhost:4443`
- SOC webhook integration: Wazuh alerts forwarded to `/api/ingest`

### Simulated Endpoints
- **endpoint-pc-01** / **endpoint-pc-02**: Ubuntu 22.04 + Wazuh agent
- Log generator producing realistic auth, sudo, cron, file integrity events
- Logs flow through Wazuh → SOC dashboard

### Firewall Container (v1.2)
- Ubuntu 22.04 + iptables, Wazuh agent registered as `firewall-gw`
- Dual-homed: `dmz-net` (172.25.0.0/24, external) + `infra-net` (internal)
- Real iptables rules: FORWARD DROP default, NAT masquerade, LOGGING chain
- Log generator writes realistic `IPTables-Dropped` / `HTTP-Access` syslog entries
- Logs collected by Wazuh → forwarded to SOC

### Suricata IDS Container
- Ubuntu 22.04 + Suricata (OISF PPA) + Wazuh agent 4.14.2
- Network: `dmz-net` only — monitors external-facing traffic
- EVE JSON log generator produces realistic Suricata alerts (ET OPEN signatures), DNS, HTTP, TLS events
- Wazuh integration: `log_format: json` for `/var/log/suricata/eve.json`; built-in rules 86xxx decode EVE format
- Custom rules 100200-100202 in `local_rules.xml` for severity escalation
- Source ID: `ids` (purple `#8b5cf6`) — displayed as `IDS / Suricata` in frontend
- Caps: `NET_RAW`, `SYS_NICE`

### GLPI (IT Asset Management)
- `diouxx/glpi` + MariaDB backend
- Pre-populated with 2 computers (endpoint-pc-01, endpoint-pc-02)
- REST API consumed by SOC backend

### Network Topology
```
[dmz-net 172.25.0.0/24]
        │
  [firewall-gw]  ← iptables NAT + Wazuh agent
  [suricata-ids] ← EVE JSON + Wazuh agent
        │
[infra-net]

## Dashboard Analytics & UX (v1.3)

### Trend Indicators on StatCards
- **% change vs previous 24h** on Security Events and Critical Alerts cards
- Green/red arrows with percentage (TrendingUp / TrendingDown icons)
- Backend: `/dashboard/stats` now returns `events_prev_24h` and `critical_prev_24h`

### Event Volume Chart Enhancements
- Time range selector: `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `6h`, `24h`, `7d`, `30d`
- Clickable data points → navigate to Events page filtered by time
- Loading state during range changes

### Severity Trend Chart (7d / 30d)
- Stacked area chart showing daily breakdown by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Only visible when time range is `7d` or `30d`
- Backend: `/dashboard/trends` returns `daily` array with per-severity counts

### Activity Heatmap
- Weekly heatmap (7 days × 24 hours) showing event density
- Color intensity based on event count per hour-slot
- Backend: `GET /api/dashboard/heatmap` — aggregates events by day-of-week and hour

### Top Source IPs Widget
- Horizontal bar chart of top 10 source IPs (last 24h)
- Color-coded bars: red (critical), orange (high), blue (normal)
- Critical/high severity badges per IP
- Backend: `GET /api/dashboard/top-ips` — JSONB query on `metadata.source_ip`

### Alerts by Source (Donut Chart)
- Interactive donut chart with source breakdown (Firewall, Endpoints, GLPI)
- Click a slice to filter RecentAlertsTable by source
- Filter badge shown on table when active

### Recent Alerts Table Enhancements
- **Quick Actions column**: Eye (view details) + UserCheck (assign to me) buttons
- **Quick assignment**: one-click self-assign via `updateEventStatus`
- **Assignee dropdown**: click to reassign (admin/supervisor only via RBAC)
- **Live feed animation**: new entries flash blue highlight (`animate-new-entry`) and fade
- **Source filter**: linked to donut chart selection

### Alert Detail Modal — Quick Actions
- **Toggleable action buttons**: Create Ticket, Block Source IP, Isolate Endpoint, Run Playbook
- Instant visual feedback (green checkmark on click, re-clickable to undo)
- Actions logged in modal's timeline tab

### Endpoint Status Card Enhancements
- **Degraded/offline sub-text**: shows reason under endpoint name
  - Offline: `"{N} critical alert(s) detected"` (red)
  - Degraded: `"{N} events, high severity alerts"` (yellow)
- Click to open detail modal with health score, IP, location, event stats
- Quick actions: View Logs, Restart Services, Investigate

### Live Mode
- Toggle button (LIVE / Paused) in dashboard header
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds when live
- Green pulsing indicator on alerts table

---

## SOC Analyst UX Improvements (v1.5)

### Language Consistency
- All UI strings standardized to **English** (previously mixed French/English)
- French day names, chart titles, and labels converted to English
- Date locale formatting (`fr-FR`) kept for timestamps

### Event Trend Color Fix
- **Security-context aware** trend indicators: more events = bad (red/amber), fewer events = good (green)
- Amber threshold for >50% deviation, red for >100% regardless of direction
- Previously showed green for increases (misleading in security context)

### Alert Grouping (Reduce Alert Fatigue)
- Duplicate alerts grouped by `alertName + source` in the Recent Alerts table
- Shows count badge (`23x`) next to grouped alert names
- Reduces 1,000 brute-force lines to a single grouped entry

### False Positive Quick Action
- `Ban` icon button in Recent Alerts table Actions column
- One-click false positive marking directly from dashboard (no need to open modal)

### IP Quick Actions (OSINT)
- Hover over any IP in Top Source IPs widget to reveal action menu
- **Whois Lookup** — opens who.is in new tab
- **VirusTotal** — opens VirusTotal IP page in new tab
- **Block IP** — simulated block action with toast confirmation

### Playbook Integration on Alerts
- "Run Playbook" in Alert Detail Modal now shows **real playbook picker**
- Fetches active playbooks from backend and displays selectable list
- **Recommended** badge on playbooks matching the event type/severity
- Executes playbook via backend API with event context (eventId, startedBy)

---

## Internationalization / i18n (v1.6)

### EN/FR Language Toggle
- One-click language toggle button in the **top header bar** (🇬🇧 EN / 🇫🇷 FR)
- Instant language switch — no page reload required
- Language persisted to `localStorage` (survives refresh)
- Default language: English

### Implementation
- **Lightweight i18n system** — no external library, uses React Context + translations dictionary
- `LanguageContext` provider with `t(key)` translation function
- `locale()` helper for date/number formatting (`en-US` / `fr-FR`)
- ~150 translation keys per language covering all dashboard components

### Translated Components
All dashboard-facing components use `t()` for user-visible strings:
- Dashboard (header, stat cards, live mode toggle)
- Sidebar navigation (Layout)
- TopBar (system status, user menu, notifications)
- Event Volume Chart, Severity Trend Chart, Activity Heatmap
- Recent Alerts Table (headers, empty states, action labels)
- Alert Detail Modal (tabs, fields, status buttons, quick actions, playbook picker)
- Endpoint Status Card (status labels, detail modal fields)
- Top Source IPs (title, action menu, OSINT links)
- StatCard (trend label)

---

## Dashboard V3 Redesign (v1.7)

### Activity Heatmap V3
- **Date-based grid**: real calendar dates (not day-of-week aggregation) — last 7 or 30 days × 24 hours
- **Severity breakdown per cell**: Critical / High / Med-Low counts shown in hover tooltip
- **7d / 30d toggle**: switch between weekly and monthly view; backend `GET /api/dashboard/heatmap?days=N`
- **Click-to-filter time slice**: click any cell to filter Recent Alerts table to that hour
- **Column crosshair guide** and selected-cell animation for clarity
- All labels fully translated (EN/FR) via `t()` — keys under `heatmap.*` namespace
- Backend `HeatmapEntry` now returns `{ date, hour, count, critical, high, medium, low }`

### StatCard Mission Critical Redesign
- **Sparkline SVG** rendered behind value at 20% opacity — `sparklineData?: number[]` prop
- **statusColor** prop (`normal | success | warning | critical`) — drives icon bg/border color and card tint
- **subValue** prop — secondary metric line below main value (replaces trend indicator slot when set)
- Backward-compatible: existing cards without new props remain unchanged

### Sources Health Panel
- Click the **Sources** stat card to open a right-side drawer showing real-time health per event source
- Each source card shows: ACTIVE / DISCONNECTED badge, last signal time, EPS (events/60s), 24h event count, and source-specific metadata
- **ACTIVE/DISCONNECTED logic**: primarily driven by `event_type="keepalive"` heartbeat events (< 10 min ago = ACTIVE); GLPI uses real-time HTTP check against the GLPI API on each request
- Sources order: Firewall → Endpoint → IDS / Suricata → Application (GLPI)
- Source-specific metadata: Firewall shows host label; Endpoint shows active agent count; IDS shows last rule signature; Application shows GLPI connected/timeout status

### Heartbeat-Based Health Monitoring
- Each log generator (`endpoints`, `firewall`, `suricata`) POSTs `event_type="keepalive"` to `/api/ingest` every 5 minutes via a background thread
- GLPI health is determined by a real-time HTTP request from the backend to `glpi-crm/apirest.php/initSession` (HTTP 401 = up, exception = down)
- Heartbeats are stored in the events table but excluded from all dashboard stats, charts, heatmap, realtime WebSocket feed, and endpoint metrics — they are pipeline health signals only
- `GET /api/dashboard/source-details` returns `last_keepalive_at` (ISO string + `Z` suffix) per source alongside security event stats

### Events Filter Cleanup
- Removed 3 fake sources from Events page filter dropdown: Network, Email, Active Directory
- Dropdown now shows only real sources: All Sources, Firewall, IDS, Endpoint, Application

### Light Theme Fixes
- Added CSS overrides for Tailwind opacity variants used by ActivityHeatmap V3:
  `bg-slate-900/50`, `bg-slate-800/60`, `bg-slate-800/50`, `bg-slate-800/40`, `border-slate-800/80`
- Pattern: `[data-theme="light"] .bg-slate-900\/50 { ... }` (escaped backslash in CSS selector)

---

## AI Triage Assistant (v1.8)

### Automated Triage Brief Generation
When an incident is created, a background Celery task automatically:
1. Extracts up to 3 unique non-private source IPs from linked events
2. Enriches each IP in parallel via VirusTotal + AbuseIPDB (skips on error/no key)
3. Calls Qwen2.5:1.5B via local Ollama to generate a structured JSON brief
4. Retries with a stricter prompt if the LLM returns non-JSON
5. Emits a `triage_update` WebSocket event when ready (or failed)

### TriageBriefPanel Component
Mounted in the Incident detail panel — shows the brief as it progresses:
- **Pending/Generating**: pulsing spinner + "Generating triage brief…" message
- **Ready**: confidence meter (green ≥70%, amber 40–69%, red <40%), threat hypothesis, MITRE tactic chips (clickable → attack.mitre.org), recommended action, generation footer (model + seconds)
- **Failed**: error message + Regenerate button
- **Analyst actions**: Accept ✓ / Edit ✏ / Dismiss ✗ — recorded with reviewer name + timestamp
- **Edit mode**: in-line textarea for analyst notes; saves to backend via PATCH

### State Machine
```
POST /incidents → [PENDING] → [GENERATING] → [READY] → [ACCEPTED/EDITED/DISMISSED]
                                          └──────────── [FAILED] ──→ Regenerate
```

### Backend
- `triage_briefs` PostgreSQL table (UUID PK, JSONB for mitre_tactics + ip_enrichment)
- `GET /api/triage-briefs?incident_id=` — most recent brief for an incident
- `PATCH /api/triage-briefs/:id` — accept / edit (with notes) / dismiss
- `POST /api/incidents/:id/retriage` — trigger a new brief (409 if already in-flight)
- `POST /api/incidents` — create incident + auto-fire triage
- Pure service layer (`triage_service.py`) — `extract_ips`, `enrich_ips` (ThreadPoolExecutor), `build_triage_prompt`, `parse_llm_response`
- Prompt injection mitigation: log data wrapped in `[UNTRUSTED LOG DATA]` delimiter
- Ollama retry: 3× on ConnectionError with 2s/4s/8s backoff

### Infrastructure
- `soc-ollama` Docker service (`ollama/ollama:latest`, port 11434, `ollama_data` volume)
- Config: `OLLAMA_URL`, `OLLAMA_MODEL` (default `qwen2.5:1.5b`), `VT_API_KEY`, `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`

### Tests
- 32 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_triage_service.py`) — service pure functions
- 22 integration tests (`tests/integration/test_triage_task.py`) — task pipeline + API routes

---

## Raw Log Explainer (v1.9.1)

"Explain this log" button in the Event detail panel. One click calls the local LLM synchronously
and renders a plain-English explanation inline — no Celery, no DB write, no new table.

### How it works
```
User clicks "Explain this log"
       │
       └──► POST /api/events/:id/explain   (sync, timeout 30s)
                    │
                    ├── fetch event.raw_log + source + event_type
                    ├── build_explain_prompt() — [UNTRUSTED LOG DATA] wrapper
                    ├── POST http://ollama:11434/api/chat
                    └── return {"explanation": "plain English text"}
```

### Prompt injection protection
Raw log content is wrapped in `[UNTRUSTED LOG DATA]` / `[END UNTRUSTED LOG DATA]` delimiters
(same pattern as the triage brief). If a log line contains "Ignore all previous instructions…",
the model is instructed to treat that section as untrusted data, not as a directive.

### UI
- **Trigger**: "🪄 Explain this log" button appears below the raw_log block when an event has log content
- **Loading**: button becomes "Explaining…" spinner while waiting (~4s)
- **Result**: violet left-border callout box: `AI: An inbound TCP SYN packet from…`
- **Reset**: explanation clears automatically when switching to a different event

### Backend
- `POST /api/events/:id/explain` — 15 lines in `events.py`; 503 on Ollama down, 504 on timeout
- `build_explain_prompt()` in `triage_service.py` — truncates raw_log to 1000 chars
- Falls back to `event.description` when `raw_log` is null; returns 400 if neither exists

### Tests
- 3 unit tests (`tests/unit/test_triage_service.py`) — prompt includes source/type/log, truncation, fallback
- 5 integration tests (`tests/integration/test_explain_endpoint.py`) — 200, 400, 404, 503, 504

---

## Compliance Export Suite (v1.10)

### Export Dialog
- Replaces the old single-button dropdown on the Events page
- **Scope selector**: Current page (visible events) / All filtered events / Custom date range
- **Format selector**: CSV / JSON / PDF (quick) / PDF (compliance — audit-ready badge)
- Live event-count preview with per-severity breakdown before exporting
- Large-export warning (>5000 events) recommends CSV over PDF/JSON
- Filters from the Events page (severity, source, status, search) are carried into the export

### Backend Export Endpoints
- `GET /api/events/export?format=csv|json` — streams matching events. CSV uses Flask `stream_with_context` + SQLAlchemy `yield_per(500)` to handle large exports without loading rows into memory. Max 100 000 rows enforced.
- `GET /api/events/export/summary` — aggregate counts (per severity / status / source) + time range, no row payload. Used for the cover page of the compliance PDF and the live preview.
- Shared `_build_event_query()` helper means all three event endpoints (`list_events`, `export_events`, `export_summary`) honour identical filter semantics.

### Compliance PDF (`utils/complianceReport.ts`)
- Multi-page audit-ready report rendered client-side with html2pdf.js
- **Cover page**: report ID, analyst + role, generation timestamp, scope, active filters, SHA-256 hash of the raw events JSON (via `crypto.subtle.digest`)
- **Summary page**: severity / status / source breakdowns + first/last event timestamps
- **Event detail pages**: paginated tables with `page-break-inside: avoid` on rows and headers
- Inline SVG icons (shield, lock) replace emojis to avoid baseline-misalignment in html2canvas
- `pagebreak: { mode: ['css', 'legacy'], avoid: ['tr', 'thead'] }` — page-break rules pulled out of `@media print` because html2pdf renders via html2canvas, not print media

### Glass Chronos Date Range Picker (`components/DateRangePicker.tsx`)
- Replaces the native `<input type="datetime-local">` (a "UI killer")
- Glassmorphic surface: `rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.6)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` + `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`
- **Dual-month calendar** view with `ChevronLeft/Right` navigation
- Soft blue tint (`rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.15)`) for days inside the range; solid blue + box-shadow glow on the start/end edges
- **Quick presets sidebar**: Last 15m / 1h / 24h / 7d — for "click and export in under 2 seconds" incident workflow
- "Next click → Set START / Set END" hint tracks selection state
- **Horizontal time sliders** (H 0–23, M 0–59) with white-ringed blue thumbs and blue glow (`box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(59,130,246,0.6)`) — replaces the AM/PM scroll wheel
- The active side (start vs end, based on next click target) lights up with a blue tint + border
- Modal width auto-expands from `max-w-2xl` to `max-w-4xl` when range scope is selected

---

## Realtime Events & Demo-Ready Experience (v1.11)

### Realtime Events Page
- **LIVE / OFFLINE pill** in header — reflects WebSocket connection state
- **Socket subscription** to `new_event` — incoming events prepend on page 1; on other pages a "N new events — jump to top" banner appears
- **Inline "Explain" affordance** on every `EventCard` row when `raw_log` is present — no need to open the drawer to trigger the LLM explainer
- **Site filter dropdown** populated from `/api/endpoints` (replaces hard-coded list)
- Theme-aware explanation block (removes hardcoded inline styles for light theme)
- Per-row delete action with confirmation

### Event Grouping & Burst Detection (`utils/eventGroup.ts`)
- Groups events by `alertName + source` to fight alert fatigue on the Events page
- **Burst detection**: flags groups where ≥5 events fire within ≤60s as a burst (`isBurst: true`)
- Surfaces **unique source IPs** per group and **freshness** (last event within 5 min)
- `EventCard` shows grouped count badge (`23x`) and a `BURST` chip when applicable, plus IP chips for the first N unique sources
- Expand/collapse toggle on grouped rows

### Incident PDF Export (`exportIncidentReport`)
- **Export button** in `AlertDetailModal` (gated by `canExport` RBAC flag)
- Multi-page PDF includes: overview, triage brief, MITRE tactics, timeline, comments
- Locale-aware date formatting — `locale()` from `LanguageContext` threaded through both `export.ts` and `complianceReport.ts`
- Shares html2pdf config and SVG icon set with the compliance suite

### Alerts Tab Completion
- **Full EN/FR i18n coverage** — Alert Rules tab, Triggered tab, rule form, `AlertRuleDetailPanel`, and `describeCondition()` now translate together; no more mixed-locale flashes when toggling 🇬🇧/🇫🇷
- **CustomSelect dropdowns** replace native `<select>` in Alerts filters and the rule form — matches the dark-themed dropdown style used on Events
- `--color-bg-tertiary` defined in both themes (was referenced but undefined, caused transparent dropdown backgrounds)
- `AlertRuleDetailPanel` drawer fixed to `bottom-0 h-screen` so footer buttons render

### Recommended Playbook CTA
- `AlertDetailModal` pre-fetches active playbooks on open
- **Recommended Playbook banner** above tabs with one-click Run — surfaces the best-match playbook by category/severity before the analyst has to dig
- Shared `runPlaybook()` helper (de-duplicates with the picker)

### Triage Brief Polish
- Polling capped at ~60s; on timeout shows "AI worker not responding" with a Retry button
- Enrichment status badge: green "X IPs enriched" / amber "Enrichment skipped — no API key"

### Dashboard Polish
- **LIVE pulse animation** on relevant KPI cards when realtime events arrive
- Fake placeholders ("Avg. Time to Resolve: 12m", "Ingestion: 1.2 MB/s") replaced with i18n strings backed by real values
- `/dashboard/stats` zero-fills every `EventSource` so the Sources card never reads "2/4" mid-demo
- `/dashboard` zero-fills `by_source` with the 4 active sources (firewall / endpoint / application / ids)

### Sidebar Demo Flow
- Reordered to mirror the demo narration: **Dashboard → Events Log → Alerts → Incidents → Playbooks → Assets → Sites**
- Presenter walks top-to-bottom without context switches

### Timeline Context Chips
- `AlertDetailModal` timeline tab now renders context chips on each entry (status, source, severity) for at-a-glance scanning

### Time-bound Incident Merge
- Alert engine merges new matches into an existing open incident only when within the rule's timeframe window — prevents one stale incident from absorbing months of unrelated bursts

### Timestamp Hygiene
- `Event.timestamp` defaults to tz-aware UTC; log generator writes UTC
- Alert and Incident timestamps serialize with explicit `Z` suffix so the JS frontend always parses as UTC

### Playbook Steps UX
- Per-step "Saving…" spinner on Complete/Skip with success/error toast feedback
